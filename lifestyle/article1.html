  <p>It may look different this year, but the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is still on for 2021.</p>
  <p>Because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the 145-year-old competition was moved from inside New Yorkâ€™s Madison Square Garden to outdoors on the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown, about 25 miles north of Manhattan, for the first time. The event was also postponed from its traditional dates in February to June for the warmer weather.</p>
  <p>In-person spectators will not be allowed and there will only be a minimal media presence. All human participants have to be vaccinated or newly tested.</p>
  <p>The last Westminster show concluded Feb. 11, 2020, when there were only 13 confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide, though the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since concluded the virus was already more prevalent. Within about a month, holding a public event was unthinkable.</p>
  <p>Event organizers considered various options for the 2021 event, finally deciding last fall to hold it at the 67-acre Lyndhurst estate.</p>
  <p>The competition will return to Madison Square Garden in January 2022.</p>
