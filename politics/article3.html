  <p>New York City will hold a massive ticker-tape parade in Lower Manhattan on July 7 to thank the city’s doctors and nurses along with other "hometown heroes" who helped get the Big Apple through the pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday.</p>
  <p>"It’s going to be example of the great tradition of ticker-tape parades, a ticker-tape parade up the Canyon of Heroes," said the mayor.</p>
  <p>The parade route has seen Charles Lindbergh, Winston Churchill, the Apollo 11 astronauts, Pope John Paul II as well as the Mets, Yankees, Rangers and Giants championship teams lauded with ticker tape or its replacement, shredded office paper, streaming from the towers lining it.</p>
  <p>"It’s time for the parade to celebrate our hometown heroes. We’re always going to remember the pain and the tragedy of COVID. No one is going to ever forget those we lost and what families are still going through, but we need a day to celebrate the heroism of everyday New Yorkers," de Blasio said during his daily press conference.</p>
