  <p>Denmark soccer star Christian Eriksen said in a statement Monday he was feeling better after collapsing on the field during a Euro 2020 matchup against Finland over the weekend.</p>
  <p>Eriksen thanked fans for their support while it was still unclear why he suffered an on-field medical incident during the matchup. The midfielder’s remarks were released through his agent to Italy’s Gazzetta dello Sport. Eriksen plays for Inter Milan of Serie A in Italy.</p>
  <p>"Thank you, I won't give up. I feel better now - but I want to understand what's happened. I want to say thank you all for what you did for me," the statement read.</p>
  <p>Denmark’s team doctor Morten Boesen said Sunday that Eriksen "was gone" before being resuscitated with a defibrillator. He was given lengthy medical treatment before regaining consciousness.</p>
  <p>"He was gone. And we did cardiac resuscitation. And it was cardiac arrest," Boesen said. "How close were we? I don’t know. We got him back after one defib. That’s quite fast."</p>
