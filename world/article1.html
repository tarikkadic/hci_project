  <p>MANILA — The International Criminal Court prosecution has requested authorization to open an investigation of killings in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs.</p>
  <p>In a public request Monday, outgoing prosecutor Fatou Bensouda formally asked for an investigation of drug-war killings between 2016, when the populist Duterte won the presidential election, and 2019, when the Philippines withdrew from the ICC. The Duterte government continues to wage the bloody campaign.</p>
  <p>“Information obtained by the Prosecution suggests that state actors, primarily members of the Philippine security forces, killed thousands of suspected drug users and other civilians during official law enforcement operations,” Bensouda wrote. “Markedly similar crimes were committed outside official police operations, reportedly by so-called ‘vigilantes,’ although information suggests that some vigilantes were in fact police officers, while others were private citizens recruited, coordinated, and paid by police to kill civilians.”</p>
  <p>Bensouda wrote in a statement Monday that she filed the request after her office concluded its three-year preliminary examination of the situation. “On the basis of that work, I have determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed,” she wrote.</p>
  <p>Officially, Philippine authorities reported more than 6,000 deaths in government operations between 2016 and 2020. Human rights watchdogs estimate a number up to five times that, and the ICC estimated “between 12,000 and 30,000” killings.</p>
  <p>Bensouda also requested that killings between 2011 and 2016 in Davao City, Duterte’s hometown, where he served as mayor, be included in the investigation, as well as allegations of “torture and other inhumane acts” dating to November 2011.</p>
  <p>Duterte’s government has yet to respond to the ICC move. In remarks last week, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the government was working to investigate abuses committed by security officers and cooperate with the United Nations to promote a “human-rights-based approach to combating drugs.”</p>
  <p>The government has sought to make the case that it can deal with police abuse domestically. Earlier this month, however, Duterte said he would not grant rights watchdogs full access to drug-war records, citing national security concerns.</p>
