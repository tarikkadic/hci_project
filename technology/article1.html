  <p>House lawmakers on Friday introduced a slew of antitrust bills they say aim to rein in the power and reach of Big Tech companies, but some conservatives are warning that the legislation would give the federal government too much control over the tech sector, while others are concerned the proposals would adversely effect the broader economy and U.S. competitiveness.</p>
  <p>The bills, which have some bipartisan support, including from Republican Reps. Ken Buck, Madison Cawthorne, Burgess Owens, Victoria Sparks, Matt Gaetz and Chip Roy, take aim at top tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. The bills, though, do not address Twitter.</p>
  <p>"Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy. They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers and put folks out of work," Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee told the Wall Street Journal Friday. "Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us."</p>
  <p>U.S. antitrust laws havenâ€™t been updated significantly in almost 100 years, according to Buck's office.</p>
  <p>In general, the bills would seek to have the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission assign "covered platforms" to include companies with at least 500,000 users in the U.S. and with $600 billion in revenue. Once designated, those companies considered "covered platforms" would have regulations imposed on mergers, data and general company practices.</p>
