  <p class="article_subtitle">In just the last 24 hours, we’ve learned that JBS Foods paid a ransom of nearly $11 million</p>

<div class="article_text">
  <p>In just the last month, the United States and businesses within have succumbed to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks. Most of these attacks could have been prevented, including that which targeted the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS Foods, and another which singled out iConstituent, a vendor that provides assistance with constituent services to members of Congress.</p>
  <p>As if the ransomware attacks themselves aren’t astonishing enough, in the last month, we’ve seen record ransom demands met by American companies.</p>
  <p>In fact, in just the last 24 hours, we’ve learned that JBS Foods paid a ransom of nearly $11 million. This payment, according to its U.S. Division Chief Executive Officer, was necessary to prevent further plant disruptions and to limit the potential impact it might have on the American supply chain.</p>
  <p>The ransomware attack on JBS Foods, which prompted it to shut its five largest beef processing plants in the United States, is similar to the ransomware attack that halted operations of the Colonial Pipeline. Causing drivers to rush in a panic to the pump for nearly a week, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack resulted in a $4.4 million ransom being paid to the perpetrators.</p>
