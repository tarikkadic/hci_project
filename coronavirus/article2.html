  <p>New COVID-19 cases are declining across most of the country, even in some states with vaccine-hesitant populations. But almost all states bucking that trend have lower-than-average vaccination rates, and experts warn that relief from the pandemic could be fleeting in regions where few people get inoculated.</p>
  <p>Case totals nationally have declined in a week from a seven-day average of nearly 21,000 on May 29 to 14,315 on Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. For weeks, states and cities have been dropping virus restrictions and mask mandates, even indoors.</p>
  <p>Experts said some states are seeing increased immunity because there were high rates of natural spread of the disease, which has so far killed nearly 600,000 Americans.</p>
  <p>"We certainly are getting some population benefit from our previous cases, but we paid for it," said Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs. "We paid for it with deaths."</p>
  <p>More than 7,300 Mississippians have died in the pandemic, and the state has the sixth-highest per capita death rate.</p>
  <p>Dobbs estimated that about 60% of the state’s residents have "some underlying immunity."</p>
  <p>"So we’re now sort of seeing that effect, most likely, because we have a combination of natural and vaccine-induced immunity," Dobbs said.</p>
