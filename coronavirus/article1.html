  <p class="article_title">Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, flu shot coadministration likely ‘viable strategy,’ company says</p>
  <p class="article_subtitle">Coadministration involves multiple vaccines administered at the same time</p>

<div class="article_text">
  <p>Maryland-based biotech company Novavax on Monday announced its experimental COVID-19 vaccine remained effective when coadministered with an approved flu shot. Researchers and drug makers are interested in studying coadministration and associated safety and efficacy, or giving multiple vaccines to a person during one visit, to ease logistics and help patients catch up on missed vaccinations, especially amid the pandemic.</p>
  <p>The news comes hours after Novavax announced on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine was found to be over 90% effective overall, and offered 100% protection against moderate and severe disease in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The company said it intends to file for FDA authorization in the third quarter.</p>
  <p>Preliminary findings from a Phase 3 clinical trial, posted ahead of peer review, involved 431 volunteers in the U.K. enrolled in a coadministration sub-study, in which all participants received an approved flu shot. About half also received the company’s investigational COVID-19 vaccine while the rest were given placebo.</p>
  <p>"The study demonstrated that vaccine efficacy appeared to be preserved in those receiving both vaccines compared to those vaccinated with NVX-CoV2373 alone," the company wrote in a statement posted Monday. "The protection afforded by the candidate vaccine was consistent with the main study at 87.5% (sub study) and 89.8% (main study) respectively."</p>
