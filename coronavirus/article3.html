  <p>The leaders of the world’s richest countries pledged to send more than 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer nations, endorsed a global minimum tax on multinational corporations and agreed to jointly challenge Chinaj’s "non-market economic practices" and call on Beijing to respect human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>Speaking at the end of a G-7 leaders’ summit in southwest England on Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the promised vaccine doses would come both directly and through the international COVAX program.</p>
  <p>The commitment falls far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world’s population and truly end the pandemic.</p>
  <p>The decision to support a minimum corporate tax had been widely anticipated after finance ministers earlier this month embraced placing a global tax of at least 15% on large multinational companies to stop corporations from using tax havens to avoid paying their share.</p>
